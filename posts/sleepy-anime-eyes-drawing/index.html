While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=sleepy-girl-base-by-x-fluffypandas-x-on-deviantart>Sleepy Girl Base By X-FluffyPandas-X On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sleepy-girl-base-by-x-fluffypandas-x-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://orig00.deviantart.net/4949/f/2013/102/3/b/sleepy_girl_base_by_x_fluffypandas_x-d61hxuw.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3j8WP7IQQtbjYsoNVBa-EwHaHa&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Sleepy girl base by X-FluffyPandas-X on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: x-fluffypandas-x.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>girl sleepy base sleepless deviantart night shift stay.</p></blockquote><p>What is anime and why are people interested in it?
