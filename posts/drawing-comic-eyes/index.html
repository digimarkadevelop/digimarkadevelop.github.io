Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=drawing-comic-eyes--skillshare-student-project>Drawing Comic Eyes | Skillshare Student Project<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#drawing-comic-eyes--skillshare-student-project>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://static.skillshare.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=85,width=1242,height=839,format=auto/uploads/project/253660/cover_1242_e0a8596707e323e13e58bdcb37cd5650.png" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KV4AKDEPGPsobw_m7V4ACAHaFA&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Drawing Comic Eyes | Skillshare Student Project"><p><em>Source: skillshare.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Most people know wallpaper as a background thing that needs to be filled in when the main window is not displaying.
